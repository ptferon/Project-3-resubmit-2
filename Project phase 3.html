      <h2 id="phase3-1">Lesson 1: Object Oriented Programing</h2>
       <ul class="notes">
         <li>Object oriented programing is the idea of breaking programing into smaller "ojects" and writing code to in the form a procedures/functions which are call methods.</li>
         <li>By breaking the problem or program into smaller pieces it makes it easier for programmers to desing a program or solve a problem.</li>
         <li>Each objects can interact with other object to build the program.</li>
         <li>Abstract thinking:  HTML uses div tags to break a website into "boxes".  Each box can be designed and opporate differently. When you put all of the "boxes" together you have the structure or framework of your webpage. </li>
         <li>Abstract thinking: CSS makes use of "classes" to add style to an HTML structure.  Much like "objects" in OOP "classes" is CSS can be reused.  In both cases programmers can avoid repetition, mistakes, and edit in a more efficient manner. </li>
         <li>OOP is important to programers because OOP is focused on the data &#40;Object&#41; that gets the intended output.  Programmers can identify objects needed to solve a problem and design the object to solve that particular problem.  These objects work independtly to solve their own problem and at the same time interact with each other and work together to solve the "bigger" task at hand</li>
         <li>Abstract thinking: Building a new home requires objects like Structure/framing, electrical, plumming, HVAC, and landscapping.  A designer can build each independantly with its own set of responsibilties.  Yet they all need to work toghether to achieve the ultimate goal of building the house.</li>
         <li>Breaking the constuction/program into objects allows the designer to focusing on one "object" say the HVAC; the programmer/designer may be able to reuse a design or "object", perhaps from a different job, thus saving time and resources </li>

       <ul class="notes">
        <li>A module is file that contains python defintions and statemnets.  The file name is the module name with .py at the end of it.  You can create your own modules that you can call when needed.  These "modules" can be "imported" to other modules that you create.  In this way you can avoid writing new code and begin to create scripts.   
         <li>We learned about Modules that are part of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/index.html">"Python Standard Library"</a>  This includes <span class='line'>webbowser.open</span> and <span class='line'>time.sleep</span></li>
         <li>Library are place for resources that are commonly used. These resources can be configuration like data, document type data, codes.  You can create your own library too.  So far we have only been introduced to the Python Standard Library</li>
         <li>These Modules have "pre" built functions for us to use and are embedded with in the python program</li>
         <li>These functions "define" how python will utilize them.  Within in time.sleep there are functions like def ctime and def sleep.  How these functions work are hidden from us.  This is known as <span class='line'>"Abstraction"</span></li>

      <h2 id="phase3-3">Lesson 3: Writing functions and calling Functions</h2>
       <ul class="notes">
         <li>We expand more on the using Modules and their functions and introduce others like <span class='line'>OS.</span> that allow us to access operating systems and directories on our computer</li>
         <li><span class='line'>import</span> is used to allow our file to access a Module and access the function. If you do not "import" the Module you will get an error </li>
         <li>You can create functions that call on the existing Modules with in Python; for example:</li>
         <li> when we import os it allows us to access the functions with in os like:</li>
         <li>os.listdir which will allow access to a file or directory that is in the variable</li>
         <li>os.rename which allows us to rename files</li>
         <li>os.chdir which allows us to change to a directory that is in the variable</li>
         <li>In short Python has Modules that  import to our files and allow us to use the functions within the Module</li>
      </ul>
    <div class='function'>
      <ol>
        <li>We open a new file in python and we import some_python_module; for exampe import webbrowser. We can def some_function and call the functions with in  sum_python_Module like def show_trailer&#40;&#41; Note: it is an empty argument</li>
        <li>We would then add arguments to produce the desired outcome for example: show_trailer&#40;Title, trailer_url&#41;</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <ul class='notes'>
      <li>We could define a <span class='line'>template</span> which allows us to make multiple copys of a file.  So we could define a template movies_info&#40;&#41; which would contain all of the functions to find the desired information then make copies of this template and save each as a seperate file say toy_story.py</li>
      <li>Once the is done we can them just call toy_story.show_trailer&#40;&#41; Note: empty argument!</li>
      <li><em>BUT</em> what if we want to make changes? We would need to change the template and all of the files assocated with it.  How can we resolve that issue?</li>

      <h2 id="phase3-4">Lesson 4: Introduction to Classes</h2>
       <ul class="notes">
           <li>A <em>Class</em> is like blue print.  It provides the structure or rules by which you can use it.  The class contains the data and methods which describe what the class will do. </li>
           <li>For example: Class <em>Turtle</em> will have methods that allow the turtle to move in different directions, choose a size, and choose a color.
           </li>
           <li>You can create multiple <em>instances</em> of a class.  For example we created two instances of the turtle, brad and angie. Both had access to the methods with in turtle that allowed us to do different things with each turtle.</li>
           <li>With in a class is the def init function.  When this function gets call the init function will create space in memory for the different instances of the class that you generate.</li>
           <li> An <em>object</em> is an <em>instance</em> of a class.  So when we created <em>Brad</em> we actually created an "object" of turtle.Turtle</li>
           <li>So brad = turtle.Turtle &#8594; Brad became an <b>Object</b> of turtle. Class Turtle&#40;&#41; calls the def__init__&#40;&#41; function and space is created in memory for Brad.</li>
           <li>def__init__ is called the contsructor.  It uses <em>self</em> or the instances being created.  Self is the <em>object</em> being created. </li>
           <li><em>Instance Variables </em> are all of the variables associated with the instance.  In our movie website creation self.title = movie_title.  This was an instance variable for what ever movie we would call.  For example toy_story.movie.title; self&#8594; toy_story and the instance varible called was self.title which we assigned to movie_title. When we input the "Toy Story" for the argument movie_title the result of print toy_story.movie.title&#8594; "Toy Story"</li>
           <li><em>Instance Methods</em> Are all of the functions inside the class that have <em>self</em> as there first argument.  For exampe def show_trailer&#40;self&#41; was an instance method of the Class Movie we created. This instance method had instance variables webbrowser.open&#40;self.trailer_youtube_url&#41;</li>
           <li><em>Class variables</em> are variables that all instances of a class can share.</li>
           <li>class variables are outside of the __init__ function which allows them to be shared among all instances of a class. </li>
           <li>Since they are a constant variable we use all caps.  In our class Movie we used the <em>class variable</em> VALID-RATINGS&#91;"G","PG", "PG-13", "R"&#93; This allowed us to access the variable with having to create an instance variable valid_ratings for each instance of the class. </li>
           <li>Python has pre-defined class variables some examples are __doc__ which will give you documentation that can describe what the varialbe does.  __name__ which will tell you the name of a varialbe. __module__ which will tell you the name of the module/file that your class was defined in.  In our class Movie the module was media.</li>

      <h2 id="phase3-5">Lesson 5: Inheritance</h2>
     <ul class="notes">
       <li><em>Inheritance</em> is when you inherit certian instance variables &#40;attributes&#41; from a parent class. </li>
       <li>when you want to inherit from a parent class you place the name of the parent class in your argument: For exampe class Child&#40;Parent&#41;</li>
       <li>When you do this you then inherit all of the instance variables</li>
       <li>Additional when you create the __init__ function for the child class you put Parent.__init__&#40;self, arg 1, arg 2...&#41; </li>
       <li><em>Method Overwritting</em> is the ability of a sub class to over write a method that was inherited from the parent class</li>
       <li><em>Inheritance</em> is important because it helps us reuse code and become more proficient programmers!</li>
